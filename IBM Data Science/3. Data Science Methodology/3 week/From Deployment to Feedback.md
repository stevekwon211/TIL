# From Deployment to Feedback

## 1. Deployment

### Understand the results

- Assimilate knowledge for business
  - Practical understanding of the meaning of model results
  - Implications of model results for designing intervention actions

### Gathering application requirements

- Application requirements
  - Automated, near-real-time risk assessments of CHF inpatients
  - Easy to use
  - Automated data preparation and scoring
  - Up-to-date risk assessment to help clinicians target high-risk patients

### Additional requirements?

- Additional requirements
  - Training for clinical staff
  - Tracking / monitoring processes

### Solution deployment

- Hospitalization risk for juvenile diabetes patients
- Risk summary report by decision tree model note
- Individual patient risk report

## 2. Feedback

### Problem solved? Question answered?

- Once the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work
  it is deployed and put to the ultimate test
  - Actual real-time use in the field
- Throughout the data science methodology, each step establishes a step for the next step.
- By creating a methodology cycle, you can ensure refinement at each stage of the game.
- The feedback process is rooted in the concept that the more you know, the more you want to know.

### Assessing model performance

- Define review process
  - To measure results of applying the risk model to the CHF patient population
  - Track patients who received intervention
    - Actual readmission outcomes
  - Measure effectiveness of intervention
    - Compare readmission rates before & after model implementation

### Refinement

- Refine model
  - Initial review after the first year of implementation
  - Based on feedback data and knowledge gained
  - Participation in intervention program
  - Possibly incorporate detailed pharmaceutical data originally deferred
  - Other possible refinements as yet unknown

### Redeployment

- Review and refine intervention actions
- Redeploy
  - Continue modeling, deployment, feedback, and refinement throughout the life of the intervention program
