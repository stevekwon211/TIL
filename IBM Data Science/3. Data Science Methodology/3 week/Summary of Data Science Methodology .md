# Summary of Data Science Methodology

## From problem to approach

- __Thinking like a data scientist!__

  - Forming a concrete business or research problem
  - Collecting and analyzing data
  - Building a model
  - Understanding the feedback after model deployment

  <br>

- __Understanding the question, and picking the most effective analytic approach are important__

  <br>

## To working with the data

- Determining the data requirements
- Collecting the appropriate data
- Understanding the data
- Preparing the data for modeling

<br>

## To deriving the answer

- Once the analytic approach is selected, learned how to derive the answer
  - Evaluating and deploying the model
  - Getting feedback on it
  - Using that feedback constructively so as to improve the model

The stages of this methodology are __iterative__!!

<br>

## The methodology in a nutshell

The __Data Science Methodology__ aims to answer the following 10 questions in this prescribed sequence

- __From problem to approach__
  1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
  2. How can you use data to answer the question?
- __Working with the data__
  3. What data do you need to answer the question?
  4. Where is the data coming from (identify all sources) and how will you get it?
  5. Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?
  6. What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?
- __Deriving the answer__
  7. In what way can the data be visualized to get to the answer that is required?
  8. Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?
  9. Can you put the model into practice?
  10. Can you get constructive feedback into answering the question?
