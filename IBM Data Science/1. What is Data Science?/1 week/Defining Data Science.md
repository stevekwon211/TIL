## Data Science can help organizations

- Understand their environments
- Analyze existing issues
- Reveal previously hidden opportunities

<br>

## Process of Data Science

- Clarify the question that he organization wants answered

What data do we need to solve the problem?

Where will that data come from?

- Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from many sources
- Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers
- This will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach

When the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller.

- Communicating the results to the project stakeholders

Data scientists can use powerful data visualization tools to help stakeholders understand the nature of the results, and the recommended action to take
