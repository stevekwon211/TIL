# What Do Data Sciencetists Do?

- Today we live in a world of overflowing data. This massive amount of data hides new revenue opportunities and strong efficiency. Data science is used to analyze these data and then effectively deal with them and produce results. That's more than just analyzing the data. It means making a model using various algorithms to explain or predict a particular phenomenon. 


  Data scientists should be very curious about data and its meaning, understand problems, and know about using appropriate algorithms. Data scientists are using statistics and computer science technology to realize the opportunity and efficiency of generating revenue hidden from vast amounts of data.


  A typical day for a data scientist is to extract data, analyze and visualize it. Then, they think and analyze to discover problems, causes, and opportunities. They spend a considerable amount of time selecting and analyzing data.

- To use Data Science, you need to apply algorithms to find accurate results and cut out unnecessary data. It is not always possible to do this on a regular offline computer. The cloud benefits from high compute requirements and data storage. Data Science requires large cloud storage to store the analyzed data. Cloud computing is the only solution to this, and with that help, computing specifications for data analysis cooperate.
