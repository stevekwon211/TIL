- __Big DL__ (Deep Learning)

## R libraries

- __ggplot2__ (Data visualisation)
- __Keras__, __TensofFlow__ (Deep Learning)



# REST APIs

- __RE__presentational __S__tate __T__ransfer APIs
- These enable us to communicate using the internet, taking advantage of storage, greater data access, artificial intelligence algorithms, and many other resources
- REST APIs are used to interact with web services, i.e. Applications that you call through the internet
- They have a set of Rules regarding
  - Communication
  - Input or Request
  - Output or Response



# Data Sets - Powering Data Science

## What is a Data Set

- Collection of data
- Data Structures
  - Tabular data

# Machine Learning Models - Learning from data to make predictions

## What is a model?

- Data can contain a welath of information
- Machine Learning (ML) models identify patterns in data
- A model must be trained on data before it can be used to make predictions
- Supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning are types of ML

## Supervised Learning

- Data is labeled and model trained to make correct predictions
- Regression
  - Predict real numerical values
  - e.g. home sale prices, stock market prices
- Classification
  - Classify things into categories
  - e.g. email spam filters, fraud detection, image classification

## Other learning types

- Unsupervised Learning
  - Data is not labeled
  - Model tries to identify patterns without external help
  - Common learning problems:  clustering and anomaly detection
- Reinforcement Learning
  - Conceptually similar to human learning processes
  - e.g. a robot learning to walk, chess, and other games of skill

## Deep Learning

- Tries to loosely emulate how hte human brain works
- Applications
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Image, audio, and video analysis
  - Time series forecasting
  - Much more
- Requires typically very large datasets of labeled data and is compute intensive

## Deep Learning Models

- Build from scratch or download from public model repositories
- Built using frameworks, such as
  - TensofFlow
  - PyTorch
  - Keras
- Popular model repositories
  - Most frameworks provides a "model zoo"
  - ONNX model zoo
