# What IBM Watson Studio Provides?

- Extract __value__ & __insights__ from your data
- Easy to create __visualisations__
- Open source tools - __Jupyter Notebooks__, __RStudio__
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning Models
- Simplified graphical interface
- Visual recognition, Language classification, and more tools
- and more...

# Some IBM Tools for Data Science

## 1. Watson Knowledge Catalog

- It is a data catalog that is integrated with an __enterprise data governance platform__, also merges the analytic capabilities of Watson Studio.
- It protects data from __misuse__ and enables the __sharing of assets with automated__, __dynamic masking of sensitive data elements__.

### Main features

- Find data
- Catalog data
- Govern data
- Understand data
- Power data science
- Prepare data
- Connect data
- Deploy anywhere

## 2. Data Refinery

- Simplifying Data Preparation
  - __Cleansing__, __Shaping__, and __Preparing__ data _take up a lot of Data Scientist's time_.
  - These tasks come in the way of the more enjoyable parts of Data Science: analysing data and building ML models.
  - Data sets are __typically not readily consumable__. They need to be __refined and cleansed__.
  - IBM Data Refinery simplifies these tasks with an __interactive visual interface__ that enables __self-service data preparation__.
  - Data Refinery comes with Watson Studio on Public/Private Cloud and Desktop

## 3. SPSS Modeller Flows in Watson Studio

<img src="https://developer.ibm.com/developer/default/tutorials/watson-studio-spss-modeler-flow/images/initial-flow.png" style="zoom: 80%;" />

- It is an example SPSS Modeller Flow, the nodes can be used to see information about the models and to get predictions for new data.

- The main flow itself defines a pipeline consisting of several steps:

  - A Data Asset node for importing the data set

  - A Type node for defining metadata for the features, including a selection of the target attributes for the classification

  - An Auto Data Prep node for preparing the data for modelling

  - A Partition node for partitioning the data into a training set and a testing set

  - An Auto Classifier node called ‘churn’ for creating and evaluating the model

## 4. Model deployment strategies

### How to deploy models?

- Workflow solutions (tend to support only models built with the same produce)
- Open standards
  - Pytorch
  - Tensorflow
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Caffe2
  - mxnet
  - Keras
  - PMML
  - and more...

### Some workflow solutions

- Sage Maker by Amazon
- MLFlow by Databricks
- Airflow from Airbnb, now at Apache
- Kubeflow from Google

### Open standards for model deployment

- __Predictive Model Markup Language__ (PMML)
  - Created by Data Mining Group (DMG) in 1990s
  - __XML__ based, version 4.4 has 17 models + many transformations and model combination methods
  - Supported by > 30 companies and Open source packages
  - Can be generated by Watson Studio and SPSS products
- __Portable Format for Analytic__ (PFA) from DMG
  - __JSON__ based small programming language
  - 5-6 years old
  - Supported by several companies and open source packages

### IBM Watson Machine Learning

- Deploy models built with __Watson Studio__, __SPSS Modeller__, many open source packages
- Support for __PMML__ and __ONNX__
- Batch or online scoring

## 5. AutoAI and Watson OpenScale

### AutoAI features

- To help simplify an AI life-cycle management, AutoAI automates
  - __Data preparation__
  - __Model development__
  - __Feature engineering__
  - __Hyper-parameter optimisation__

### OpenScale feature

- __Fairness__: Detect and mitigate model bias; automatically recommend which attributes to monitor for bias.
- __Explainability__: audit and explain model decisions.
- __Model monitoring__: Monitor model performance, help to find causes when model drift is detected, possibly trigger retraining
- __Business impact__: Correlate model metrics and business KPIs to measure business impact; actionable metrics and alerts
