# Foundations of Big Data

> Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced share holder value

- In this digital world, everyone leaves a trace from our travel habits to our workouts and entertainment.
- Devices record vast amounts of data about it

# The V's of Big Data (Different Definitions of Big Data)

## Velocity

- Velocity is the __speed__ at which data accumulates.
- __Near__ or __real-time streaming__, __local__, and __cloud-based__ technologies can process information very quickly.
- _Example_
  - Every 60 seconds, hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube which is generating data.
    And think about __how quickly data accumulates over hours, days, and years__.

## Volume

- Volume is the __scale__ of the data, or increase in the __amount__ of data stored.
- Drivers of volume are the __increase in data sources__, __higher resolution sensors__, and __scalable infrastructure__.
- _Example_
  - The world population is approximately seven billion people and the vast majority are now using digital devices; mobile phones, desktop and laptop computers, wearable devices, and so on.
    These devices all generate, capture, and store data approximately __2.5 Quintilian bytes everyday__.

## Variety

- Variety is the __diversity__ of the data.
- __Structured__ data fits neatly into rows and columns, in relational databases while __unstructured__ data is not organised in a pre-defined way,
  like __Tweets__, __blog posts__, __pictures__, __numbers__, and __videos__.
- Variety reflects that data comes from different sources
  - __machines__
  - __people__
  - __processes__
- Drivers are __mobile technologies__, __Social media__, __wearable__, __geo technologies__, __video__, and many more.
- _Example_
  - Different types of data; text, pictures, film, sound, health data from wearable devices, and many different types of data from devices connected to the __Internet of Things__.

## Veracity

- Veracity is the __quality and origin of data__, and its conformity to facts and accuracy.
- Attributes
  - __Consistency__
  - __Completeness__
  - __Integrity__
  - __Ambiguity__
- Drivers include cost and the need for trace-ability.
- _Example_
  - 80% of data is considered to be unstructured and we must devise ways to produce __reliable__ and __accurate__ insights.
    The data must be __categorised__, __analysed__, and __visualised__.

Data Scientists today derive insights from Big Data and cope with the challenges that __massive data sets__.
The scale of the data being collected means that __it's not feasible to use conventional data analysis tools__.
However, alternative tools that leverage __distributed computing power__ can overcome this problem.
Tools such as __Apache Spark__, __Hadoop__, and its ecosystem provide ways to extract, load, analyse, and process the data across distributed compute resources, providing new insights and knowledge.

## Value

- Value is our ability and need tot urn data into value
- Value is not just profit
- It may have medical, social benefits, as well as customer, employee, or personal satisfaction
- The main reason that people invest time to understand Big Data is to derive value from it

# How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation

## Digital Transformation

- Digital Transformation affects business operations, updating existing processes and operations and creating new ones to harness the benefits of new technologies.
- This digital change integrates digital technology into all areas of an organization resulting in fundamental changes to how it operates and delivers value to customers.
  It is an organisational and cultural change driven by Data Science, and especially Big Data.
- The availability of vast amounts of data, and the competitive advantage that analysing it brings has triggered digital transformations throughout many industries.
  - _Example
    - __Netflix__ moved from being a postal DVD lending system to one of the world's foremost video streaming provides.
    - __Houston Rockets__ used data gathered by overhead cameras to analyse the most productive plays.
    - __Lufthansa__ analysed customer data to improve its service.
- Most organizations realise that digital transformation will require __fundamental changes__ to their approach towards __data__, __employees__, and __customers__, and it will affect their organisational culture.
