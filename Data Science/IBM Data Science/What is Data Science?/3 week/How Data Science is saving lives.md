# How Data Science is saving lives

- Data science, such as understanding and analyzing vast amounts of data, has a diverse and significant impact on human life. 
  Thanks to data science, people can prepare early and more things. 
- For example, data science can provide doctors with the best treatment for patients or information to predict natural disasters.

  - In the medical field, data scientists use predictive analysis developed in __data mining__, __data modeling__, __statistics__, and __machine learning__ to find the best way for patients. This type of predictive analysis examines all known factors for diseases, including genetic markers, related conditions, and environmental factors. 
    
  - Appropriate tests, appropriate trials, and proposed treatments are then recommended. 
    Data science ensures that doctors have access to __up-to-date information__ on customized disease, testing, and treatment plans for specific patients. 
    This type of system allows doctors to access the same information and provides the best options to improve the patient's condition. 
    
    ### Example
    - For example, a study by __AdaMedDx__, an industry association of Boston Consulting Group and medical diagnosis firms, examined barriers to the adoption of potentially lifesaving diagnostic tests for patients with certain cancers and specific genetic markers. 
      The study found that the biggest factor that requires a specific examination for a patient is the patient's oncologist. 
    
- By providing additional information through data science tools, doctors can learn __the most useful tests__ and __treatments__ for a ___particular patient___. There are many opportunities to explore other ways to mine data, such as electronic medical records for different types of medical research. 
  
- Schools such as __NorthShore University HealthSystem in suburban Chicago__, a leader in implementing __electronic medical records (EMR)__ systems, are now guiding data mining. It is the first U.S. health care provider to receive the highest EMR deployment award for both inpatient and outpatient treatment. These remarkable efforts have produced anonymous data that can be used for innovative analytical research. Developing more sophisticated big data analytics allows medical organizations to shift from basic technical analysis to predictive insights thanks to data science. 
  
## Disaster Field

  - In disaster preparedness, lifesaving capabilities using data science tools have been developed for years. 
    Massive, high-quality data sets can be used to predict the occurrence of numerous types of natural disasters that can be the difference between the life and death of thousands of people. 
    
  - Earthquakes, hurricanes & tornadoes, floods, and volcanic eruptions __can be predicted with the help of data science__. 
  
  - A recent study by the __University of Warwick in England__ used social media content such as photos and keywords to track the development of floods, hurricanes, and other weather events. When added to the information recorded by scientists and weather stations, this type of data can be used to improve predictions for local meteorological events. The true benefits of this knowledge are so important that schools are beginning to include this type of data science education in their curriculum.
   
    
  ### Example
  - For example, the University of Chicago Graham offers a master's degree in threat and response management. Data science tools allow organizations to present that information in a way that analyzes vast amounts of data from different sources so that data scientists can obtain new knowledge.
