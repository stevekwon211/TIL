## Recommended Engine

- Companies like Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Apple use algorithms to make specific recommendations derived from customer preferences and historical behavior.

  - __Apple__
    Personal assistants like __Siri__ on Apple devices use data science to come up with answers to an infinite number of questions end users can ask.

- Example: __Netflix__
- Netflix collects and analyzes vast amounts of data from millions of users, which show people __pause__, __rewind__, __fast forward__ at __what time of day__ they are looking for and the __directors__ and __actors__ they are looking for.
- Netflix can be confident that the program will be a hit __even before shooting begins__, analyzing user preferences and acting skills for a particular director, and finding out what combination they enjoy.
  - Netflix, for example, knew that many users streamed to __David Fincher__'s work. They also knew that films featuring __Robin Wright__ always performed well and that the English version of the __House of Cards__ was very successful. Netflix knew that __many people who liked Fincher also liked Wright__. 
    All this information was combined to suggest that buying a series would be a good investment for the company. They were right. It was a huge hit.
- Thanks to data science, __Netflix__ knows in advance what people want.
