# Which language should I learn?

## Python

### Who is Python for?

- People who already know how to program
- People who want to learn to program
- Over 80% of data professionals worldwide
- Python is used heavily in data science, AI and machine learning, web development and Internet of Things (IoT) with devices like Rasberry Pi
- Large organizations like IBM, Wikipedia, GOogle, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify, Reddit

### What makes Python great?

- General Purpose language
- Large standard library

### For data science

- Scientific computing libraries like __Pandas__, __NumPy__, __SciPy__, and __Matplotlib__
- For artificial intelligence it has __PyTorch__, __TensorFlow__, __Keras__, and __Scikit-learn__
- Python can be used for __Natural Language Processing (NLP)__ using the Natural Language Toolkit (__NLTK__)

## R

### Python is Open Source, R is Free Software, what's the difference?

|                         Similarities                         |                         Differences                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|       Both commonly refer to the same set of licenses        | Open Source Initative (OSI) champions open source while the Free Software Foundation (FSF) defines free software |
|                  Both support collaboration                  | Open Source is more business focused while Free Soft ware is more focused on a set of values |
| In many cases these terms can be used interchangeably (but not all) |                                                              |

### Who is R for?

- Most often used by __statisticians__, __mathematicians__, and __data miners__ for developing statistical software, graphing, and data analysis
- The array-oriented syntax makes it easier to __translate from math to code__
- Most folks learn R a few years into their data science career, but R remains a welcoming language to those __who don't have a software programming backgorund__
- R is popular in __academia__ but companies that use R include IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Bank of America, Ford, TechCrunch, Uber, and Trulia

### What makes R great?

- R has become the __world's largest repository of statistical knowledge__
- More than 15,000 publicly released packages making it possible to conduct __complex exploratory data analysis__
- R __integrates well with other computer languages__ like C++, Java, C, .Net and Python
- Common mathematical operations like matrix multiplication work straight out of the box
- R has __stronger object-oriented programming facilities__ than most statistial computing languages

## SQL

### What is SQL?

- Officially pronounced "ess cue el" though some people say "sequel"
- SQL = __Structured Query Language__
- Older than Python and R by __20 years__, first appeared in 1974.
- SQL was initially developed at __IBM__
- Useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables

### Relational Databases

### SQL Elements

- Statement

```sql
UPDATE clause {UPDATE country
SET clause {SET population = population + 1
WHERE clause {WHERE name = 'USA' ;
```

- Expression

```sql
population + 1
```

```sql
'USA'
```

- Predicate

```sql
name = 'USA'
```

### What makes SQL great?

- Knowing SQL will help you get jobs as a __business__ and __data analyst__ and is a must in data engineering and data science
- When peroforming operations with SQL the data is __accessed directly__ (without any need to copy it beforehand). This can considerably speed up workflow executions
- SQL is the __interpreter__ between you and the database
- SQL is a ANSI standard, which means if you learn SQL and use it with one database you will be able to __easily apply your SQL knowledge with many other databases__

### Many SQL Databases Availavble

- MySQL
- IBM DB2
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Apache Open Officebase
- Oracle
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL Server
- and more...

## Other Languages

Thre are many, many other languages that are worth our time when considering which alnguage to use to solve a particular data science problem

- __Scala__
  - Scala is a general purpose programming language that proviudes __supprot for functional programming__
  - Designed as an __extension to Java__, it is inter-operable with Java as it also runs on JVM
  - The name Scala comes from "__Scalable Language__"
  - __For Data Science__
    - __Apache Spark__
