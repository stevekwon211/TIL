# What's the Difference?

## Big Data

- Data sets that are __so massive__, __so quickly built__, and __so varied__ that hey defy traditional analysis method such as performing with a __relational database__. 
- [The V's of Big Data (Click here to read more about Big Data)](https://stevekwon211.blogspot.com/2020/12/big-data.html)

<br>

## Data Mining

- Process of automatically __searching__ and __analysing data__, __discovering previously unrevealed patterns__.
- Involves __preprocessiong__ the data to prepare it and __transforming__ it into an appropriate format.
- After Data Mining is done, __insights__ and __patterns__ are mined and extracted using various tools and techniques ranging from __simple data visualisation tools__ to __machine learning__ and __statistical models__.

<br>

## Machine Learning

- __Machine Learning__ is a subset of __AI__ that uses __computer algorithms__ to analyse data and make __intelligent decisions__ based on what it has learned, without being explicitly programmed.
- Machine Learning algorithms are trained with __large sets of data__ and they learn from examples. _They do not follow rules-based algorithms_.
- Machine Learning is what enables machines to solve problems on their own and make accurate predictions using the provided data.

<br>

## Deep Learning

- Deep Learning is a __specialised subset of Machine Learning__ that uses __layered neural networks__ to simulate human decision-making.
- Deep Learning algorithms can __label__ and __categorise__ ___information and identify patterns___. 
- It is what enables AI systems to continuously learn on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results by determining whether decisions were correct.

<br>

## Neural Networks

- Take inspiration from __biological neural networks__, although they work quite a bit differently.
- Neural Network in AI is a collection of small computing units called __neurons__ that __take incoming data__ and __learn to make decisions over time__. 
- Neural Networks are often __layer-deep__ and are the reason deep learning algorithms become more efficient as the data sets increase in volume, as opposed to other machine learning algorithms that may plateau as data increases.

<br>

## Difference between Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

- is the process and method for __extracting knowledge__ and __insights__ from large volumes of disparate data. 
- It involves
  - mathematics
  - statistical analysis
  - data visualisation
  - machine learning
  - and more..
- => It is what makes it possible for us to __appropriate information__, __see patterns__, __find meaning__ from large volumes of data and use it to make __decisions that drive business__.
- It could use machine learning algorithms, even deep learning models as well.
  There is some interaction between AI and Data Science.
  __However, one is not a subset of the other__.
- It is a broad term that encompasses the entire data processing methodology while AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions.
- Both AI and Data Science can involve the use of big data.

# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Neural network and deep learning

- Computer science (artificial intelligence) is trying to mimic real neurons, just like our brain structure. There are input layers, hidden layers, and output layers in the neural network. The values of the input layer will be supplied to the other nodes to convert and incorporate them or move them to the nodes of the other layers. And finally, the output layer will produce the results.

<br>

## How does the neural network work?

- Using computer programs, neurons, and synapses that mimic the way our brains process things, build complex networks that can be trained. So the neural network starts with the input layer and some outputs, and by continuously re-entering these inputs, these inputs and transforms get output. 
- The neural network has several layers. And a lot of computing power is required to operate them. And in this computing power, graphics processing devices are essential. This is because all the mathematics required in the neural network requires enormous amounts of matrix and linear algebra calculations.
  And now deep learning can recognise our words, recognise people, recognise faces, and so on.

## What are the use cases of deep learning?

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Segmentation
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- General Adversary Networks (GAN)
- Style Transfer
- and more...

<br>

## How can I start studying neural networks?

- Have to learn linear algebra. Much of the neural network is based on a matrix and linear algebra. On the other hand, there are many packages for deep learning, and they can do all linear algebra.
