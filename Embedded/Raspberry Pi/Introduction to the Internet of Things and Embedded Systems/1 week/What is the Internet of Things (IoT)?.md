# Define of the Internet of Things (IoT)

## What is the Internet of Things?

- Start with a device (a __"Thing"__ ) - anything besides a traditional computer
- Add __computational intelligence__ to improve the function of the device
- Add a __network connection__ to the device to further enhance its function

## IoT Example - The Refrigerator

### Traditional Refrigerator

- Keeps items cold
- Doesn't do much else

### Intelligent Refrigerator

Tells us

- When the door is ajar
- When the water filter needs replacing
- When you are low on butter
- When you buy foods with high fat content
- What recipes match its contents

enhanced functionality, but still not networked

### IoT Refrigerator

- Orders food items when stock is low
- Searched for lowest food prices
- Orders water filter when needed
- Anticipates your meals; orders food preemptively
- Searches news sites for worldwide food price trends
- Provides consumption information to businesses for marketing purposes

Greatly enhanced functionality, Internet required

## IoT Devices

- Computational technology is used to enhance a product 
  - 1950's car : electro-mechanical control

  - 21st century car : computer-based control systems enable fuel injection, anti-lock braking, etc.

- Internet access gives access to external computation and data ("the cloud")
  - 1970's logistical tagging : bar code

  - 21st century logistical tagging : Intelligent RFID tags

## IoT Devices vs Computers

### IoT Devices Are Unique

- IoT devices have a main function separate from computation
  - Cars drive, phones make calls, TVs display shows, etc.
  - Computation is a means to an end

### Computers Compute!

- The main function of a computer is to compute : any type of program can be executed

### Computers are "general-purpose"

- OK at executing anything
- Not particularly efficient for type of code

### IoT devices are "special-purpose"

- Software and hardware are efficient for the task : but inefficient for other tasks
- A music player is great for playing music : but terrible for playing video
- Laptops can do both : but less efficiently

# Trends in the Adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT)

## Trends Supporting IoT

- Convergence of several trends
- Cost of hardware has decreased
  - ENIAC 1945: $500,000
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61633137/102710325-dcdf3080-42f4-11eb-9051-3ce40eb1ca93.jpg" alt="1600761620_ce97a14712_z" style="zoom:67%;" />
  - Generic laptop computer today: mostly $500 (mine is more than $1000 though lol)
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61633137/101234896-bc18b780-3706-11eb-8d53-e6117b8ee48f.jpg" alt="1" style="zoom: 25%;" />

## IoT Trend: Computational Ability

- Many IoT devices need significant computation and speed
  - Speed-to-text, audio processing, network communication
  - ENIAC 1945: instructions per second -> 5000
  - Laptop today: instructions per second -> 18 billion

## IoT Trend: Internet Access

- Internet available almost everywhere in the developed world
  - Some parts of the world still lack easy access, but this is being addressed
- Wireless access (cell phone, Wi-Fi) enables networking with cheap infrastructure
  - Less need to install physical cables
- Data costs are fairly low
- Data bandwidth is high
  - Can stream multiple movies in real-time

## IoT is Powerful and Pervasive

### Interface to the Cloud

- Siri enables search with verbal questions
- View any movie, listen to any song, read any book

### Networking is Powerful

- IoT device interfaces can leverage powerful servers and large databases

### IoT is Pervasive

- At home
  - TV/game machine can listen to your commands
  - Home automation system can control your appliances
- At work
  - Motion sensors detect your presence
  - RFID readers detect entry/exit
- On your person
  - Cellphones
  - Insulin pumps
  - Pacemaker, health monitoring devices
- Everywhere else
  - Car
  - Traffic lights (red lights cameras)

# The Importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Society

## Societal Benefits of IoT

- IoT makes life easier
  - What food do I need?
  - Are my accounts balanced?

- Independence from people
  - IoT devices handle things you needed humans for
    - Fewer doctor visits
    - no trips to the supermarket
- Link to the world!
  - Information access
  - Global interactions between people are possible

## Risks, Privacy, and Security

### IoT Risks

- Social isolation
- Dependence on technology and infrastructure
  - IoT requires power and network
  - Network outages and blackouts are more critical

### Privacy and Security

- Observation by IoT devices is pervasive
  - Location: cell phone
  - Health: health monitor
  - Media watching habits: TV/media system
  - Purchasing habits: credit card, cell phone
  - Driving habits: car incident recording
- Data may be used to market to people
  - Health problem -> Drugs may be marketed to people
- Purchasing an IoT device may give the manufacturer permission to use or sell our data
  - Consumer agreement contracts can by cryptic
- Data may be used by insurance agencies
  - Were we speeding at the time of the accident?
  - Do we have any un-diagnosed health problems?
- Data may not be held in a secure way
  - Cloud is attacked with our data inside
  - Even encrypted data is decrypted in use
